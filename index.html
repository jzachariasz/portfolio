        <h2>Project nr. 2: YelpCamp</h2>
        <p>YelpCamp is a full-stack web application I built as a part of the Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course.
            It is my first application of this kind I've ever built. I followed along with the instructor while also solving
            bugs and implementing fixes of my own, which helped deepen my understanding of the stack. The app 
            allows user to create, view, edit and review campgrounds. It includes features like:
            geolocation and coordinates, authentication and authorization, campground management, review system, form validation,
            image upload and deletion via "Cloudinary" and security features like helmet, mongo sanitize and input validation.
            This project gave me hands-on experience with technologies like Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport and EJS.

     <h2>Project nr. 3: Cool Dogs</h2>
        <p>I'm currently working on a project for a newly established dog grooming company called "Cool Dogs",
            where I'm responsible for creating the brand's entire analytical and visual foundation from scratch. I began
            the project by defining SMART goals, conducting a SWOTT analysis, thorough market research and competitor analysis.
            Based on these insights, I developed a brand strategy and created a visual identity in which every design element
            was crafted with intention. I'm now mowing on to building a simple client database and designing a website that
            will include features such as contant form submissions.

     <h2>Project nr. 4: Green Chews</h2>
        <p>Green Chews is a conceptual brand of natural, healthy candies. In this project I designed
            a fresh and modern visual identity that includes the logo, packaging and promoting materials.
            I created this project to explore visual storytelling and develop my skills in 3D product visualization using Blender.
